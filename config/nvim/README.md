# vimrcs
I currently have different vim configurations for different machines. This is due in large due to the different availability of Nerd Fonts, as well as relativ espeed of the machines.

## The Different vimrcs
- simple.vim - this vim configurations is for use in my iPad, running Alpine Linux in iSH. Due to emulation, it is relatively slow and does not support powerline or nerd fonts, hence it is extremely basic.
- init.vim + general - this vim configuration will be the main configuration used by most of my machines, with extensive features.


# TODO:
- Add more plugins: fzf, fast finder, vim commentary
